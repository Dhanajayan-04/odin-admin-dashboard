This project is part of The Odin Projectâ€™s Intermediate HTML and CSS Course, created to practice CSS Grid, Flexbox, and responsive layouts by building an admin dashboard.

## Project Overview

The odin-admin-dashboard is a modern web-based admin panel layout.  
It replicates a typical dashboard interface with sidebar navigation, a top header, project cards, announcements, and trending sections.  
This project helped me strengthen my understanding of CSS Grid, layout composition, and UI structuring.

## Features

- Responsive admin dashboard with sidebar, header, and content sections.
- CSS Grid + Flexbox for clean and adaptable layouts.
- Hover effects for interactive sidebar navigation.
- Content cards for projects, announcements, and trending users.
- Designed with a consistent visual style and reusable components.
